# Aidan's Install Preferences

Tools and software I like to have on a new machine.
If I linked you this file - it means I want you to make sure all these tools are installed.
Only applies to Linux for now - but we can add macOS later.

## Cursor Agent

```bash
curl https://cursor.com/install -fsSL | bash
```
