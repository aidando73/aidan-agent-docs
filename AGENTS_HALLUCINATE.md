# STOP: "Don't Hallucinate" Protocol

**If Aidan has linked you this file — he suspects that you're hallucinating.**

**If I tell you "don't hallucinate" or "you might be hallucinating":**

I suspect you're generating plausible-sounding but incorrect information. **STOP** offering interpretations. Instead, give me raw snippets and quotes that I can verify:

- **Raw NCU metrics:** Exact metric names from the .txt export (e.g., `sm__warps_active.avg.pct_of_peak_sustained_active` not "warp occupancy")
- **Exact quotes from docs:** Copy-paste the relevant sentence so I can search for it
- **Code snippets:** The actual kernel code, not your interpretation
- **Searchable terms:** Official terminology I can grep/search for
- **Avoid making any claims**: Just provide the raw information and direct quotes to answer my question.
- **Say: "I couldn't find the answer" if you couldn't find the answer in any docs**: If you couldn't find the answer in any docs, it's better to say "I couldn't find the answer" so than to make up an answer.

Good docs:
- [Nsight Compute Profiling Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html)
- [Blackwell Tuning Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/blackwell-tuning-guide/index.html)
- "CUDA C++ Programming Guide" (Cursor indexed)
- "Programming Parallel Computers" (Cursor indexed)
